### Final Diagnosis

- **Nocturnal arrhythmias (e.g., premature atrial/ventricular beats, non‑sustained VT, sinus node dysfunction)**  
  - *Why*: Bursts of ectopy or brief tachycardic runs can be sensed or felt during the night, triggering arousals, vivid dreams, and fragmented sleep, producing the patient’s difficulty falling asleep and frequent awakenings.

- **Early diastolic dysfunction / subclinical heart failure**  
  - *Why*: Mild elevations in left‑ventricular filling pressures can lead to nocturnal orthopnea or silent hypoxia without overt obstructive apnea, reducing sleep efficiency and leaving the patient fatigued during the day.

- **Anxiety‑related hyperarousal and mild depressive mood (burnout)**  
  - *Why*: High‑stress occupation, excess caffeine, and family history of depression create a state of hyperarousal and sleep‑to‑wake cycle instability, accounting for insomnia, daytime fatigue, and the emotional symptoms noted by the psychologist.
