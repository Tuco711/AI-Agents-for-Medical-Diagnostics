### Final Diagnosis

- **Subclinical atrial fibrillation or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia** – the cardiology report highlights irregular, low‑quality cardiac output as a likely cause of transient cerebral hypoperfusion and silent embolic brain lesions, both of which can manifest as memory loss and disorientation.

- **Late‑life depression (with possible anxiety/adjustment‑related components)** – the psychological assessment notes that progressive cognitive decline and loss of daily‑functioning are classic precipitants of depressive symptoms, which themselves can worsen cognition, reduce motivation, and lead to isolation.

- **Orthostatic hypotension / autonomic dysfunction** – the cardiologist’s table lists fluctuating blood pressure upon standing or during sleep as a contributor to episodes of reduced cerebral blood flow, which can produce confusion, falls, and episodic memory lapses.
