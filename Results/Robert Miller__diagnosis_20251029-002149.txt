### Final Diagnosis

- **Cor pulmonale (pulmonary hypertension secondary to severe COPD)** –  
  *Reason:* The cardiologist highlighted chronic hypoxia‑induced pulmonary arterial pressure and right‑heart strain; the pulmonologist’s COPD history (FEV₁ 55 % predicted, 40‑pack‑year smoking) together explain the patient’s persistent dyspnea, wheeze, and orthopnea that resemble heart failure.

- **Anxiety/Depressive adjustment disorder** –  
  *Reason:* The psychologist report lists health‑related anxiety, depressive symptoms, and difficulty adapting to the COPD diagnosis, all of which can worsen perceived shortness of breath, reduce adherence to therapy, and contribute to sleep disturbance.

- **Exacerbation‑prone COPD with potential bacterial infection or early lung cancer** –  
  *Reason:* The pulmonologist notes chronic productive cough, morning wheezing, and a family history of smoking‑related cancer. Recurrent exacerbations raise the likelihood of chronic infection and increase screening priority for early malignant changes.
