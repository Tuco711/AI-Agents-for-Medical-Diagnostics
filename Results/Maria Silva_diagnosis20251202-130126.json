Her lifestyle factors (sedentary, high carbohydrate diet) further contribute to metabolic risk. Her vital signs (BP 112/70, HR 76) and fasting glucose are currently normal. Crucially, no cardiovascular-specific symptoms, physical findings, or diagnostic test results (ECG, Echo, Holter, comprehensive blood panel) have been provided, limiting a direct assessment of her current cardiac status.

Structured Exercise Program: Emphasize regular aerobic and resistance training (at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week) to improve insulin sensitivity and facilitate weight management.\\n    c. Intensive Weight Management: Counseling and support for weight loss, as even modest reductions significantly improve PCOS symptoms and metabolic profile.\",\n    \"Endocrinology/Gynecology Collaboration: Close collaboration with the patient's primary endocrinologist/gynecologist to optimize PCOS management, including consideration of metformin (which has metabolic and potential cardiovascular benefits in PCOS) or hormonal therapies, while ensuring integrated cardiovascular risk monitoring.\"\n  ]\n}",
