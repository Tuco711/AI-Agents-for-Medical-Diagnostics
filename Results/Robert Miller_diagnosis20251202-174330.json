The chronic nature of the symptoms (cough, sputum, wheezing for 2 years) aligns with his underlying chronic bronchitis/emphysema. While Asthma-COPD Overlap Syndrome (ACOS) is a possibility, the strong smoking history and classic COPD imaging make COPD the primary focus. An acute infection like Pneumonia or Bronchitis could trigger an exacerbation, but with a normal CBC and chronic symptoms, it's less likely to be the sole primary diagnosis for the overall presentation, though it should be considered if there are acute changes like fever or increased sputum purulence.\",\n  \"First-Line Management\": \"1.  **Optimize current COPD management:** Continue Salbutamol (SABA) for rescue and Tiotropium (LAMA) daily.

The significant 40 pack-year smoking history is the primary etiological factor. Pulmonary Function Test results show a reduced FEV1 (55% predicted), consistent with obstructive lung disease. However, the absence of the FEV1/FVC ratio and DLCO significantly limits a comprehensive assessment of the severity of obstruction, the presence of air trapping, and the extent of gas exchange impairment or emphysema. Chest X-ray findings of hyperinflated lungs and flattened diaphragms are classic signs of severe obstructive disease, likely with an emphysematous component.

The Pulmonologist similarly lists 'Pulmonary Hypertension and early Cor Pulmonale' as a suspected pathology, stating that 'Long-standing, severe COPD often leads to pulmonary vascular remodeling and increased pulmonary artery pressures, eventually affecting right ventricular function.' Both specialists recommend an Echocardiogram to comprehensively assess right ventricular function and estimate pulmonary artery pressures, directly connecting the pulmonary disease to its cardiac sequelae.

This incomplete pulmonary picture means the extent of the patient's primary lung disease and potential comorbidities like bronchiectasis or co-existing Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) (which the Pulmonologist also considers) are not fully characterized. The Pulmonologist's 'First-Line Management' includes optimizing current COPD medications (stepping up inhalers) and emphasizes the paramount importance of smoking cessation, a recommendation strongly echoed by the Cardiologist for overall cardiovascular risk reduction.
