    "Senior_Psychologist": "{\n  \"Case Conceptualization\": \"Kevin's presentation of severe peripheral neuropathy, uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, while medically significant, strongly points to a deeply entrenched pattern of chronic self-neglect and maladaptive coping. His lifestyle choices (smoking, sedentary behavior, likely poor diet given his HbA1c and BMI) are not merely 'bad habits' but likely serve a profound psychological function. From a trauma-informed perspective, these behaviors could represent a form of dissociation or numbing, a way to manage overwhelming internal distress, or a re-enactment of early experiences of neglect or powerlessness. The 'burning sensation' in his feet, while physically verifiable, may also be a somatic manifestation of unacknowledged emotional pain or chronic stress. \\n\\nPsychodynamically, Kevin appears to employ denial and avoidance as primary defense mechanisms, allowing him to sidestep the severe implications of his health choices. This could be a means to maintain a fragile sense of control or to avoid feelings of fear, vulnerability, powerlessness, or grief associated with a chronic, progressive illness. The long-standing nature of these patterns (8 years since diabetes diagnosis) suggests a pervasive difficulty with self-care, potentially rooted in early attachment experiences or a chronic, internalized sense of low self-worth. He may struggle with the belief that he is deserving of care and attention, leading to a failure to prioritize his own needs. His reliance on smoking and potentially overeating indicates a significant struggle with emotional dysregulation, using these behaviors for immediate, albeit transient, comfort or distraction from underlying anxiety, depression, or existential discomfort.\",\n  \"Differential Diagnosis\": {\n    \"Primary Working Hypothesis\": \"Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) with prominent somatic symptoms and maladaptive coping, co-occurring with significant traits of Dependent and Avoidant Personality Disorder.
