### Final Diagnosis:

- **Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) or other brief ventricular arrhythmia** – the 24‑h Holter missed the brief, self‑terminating episodes that match the patient’s sudden chest discomfort, dizziness, and anxiety spikes; catecholamine surge (caffeine, job stress) can provoke such runs.  
- **Panic‑disorder‑driven hyperventilation / anxiety response** – the symptom pattern (sudden chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, sweating, dizziness) fits classic panic attacks; normal cardiac and pulmonary work‑up, and the patient’s current benzodiazepine use, suggest an anxiety‑based somatic focus rather than an organic pathology.  
- **Gastro‑oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with micro‑aspiration/airway irritation** – GERD‑related chest tightness can mimic cardiac angina and provoke dyspnea and dizziness; the absence of lung findings and persistent chest pain despite normal cardiac imaging point toward reflux‑related chest discomfort as a likely contributor.
