### Final Diagnosis:

<<<<<<< HEAD
- **Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) or other brief ventricular arrhythmia** – the 24‑h Holter missed the brief, self‑terminating episodes that match the patient’s sudden chest discomfort, dizziness, and anxiety spikes; catecholamine surge (caffeine, job stress) can provoke such runs.  
- **Panic‑disorder‑driven hyperventilation / anxiety response** – the symptom pattern (sudden chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, sweating, dizziness) fits classic panic attacks; normal cardiac and pulmonary work‑up, and the patient’s current benzodiazepine use, suggest an anxiety‑based somatic focus rather than an organic pathology.  
- **Gastro‑oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with micro‑aspiration/airway irritation** – GERD‑related chest tightness can mimic cardiac angina and provoke dyspnea and dizziness; the absence of lung findings and persistent chest pain despite normal cardiac imaging point toward reflux‑related chest discomfort as a likely contributor.
=======
- **Panic Disorder / Health‑Related Anxiety** – The psychologist's report lists classic panic‑attack features (shortness of breath, chest tightness, impending doom) and ongoing health anxiety; the cardiology work‑up found no structural or ischemic disease, supporting an anxiety‑driven origin.

- **Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVC‑related Arrhythmia)** – Holter monitoring recorded occasional PVCs, which can trigger brief chest discomfort or light‑headedness; while not sustained, they remain a plausible organic explanation for the episodic symptoms.

- **Potential Coronary Vasospasm (Prinzmetal‑type Angina)** – Episodes of chest pain, diaphoresis, and dizziness at rest fit a vasospastic pattern; normal resting ECG/echo and lack of sustained arrhythmias do not rule out micro‑vasospasm, making it a reasonable differential.
