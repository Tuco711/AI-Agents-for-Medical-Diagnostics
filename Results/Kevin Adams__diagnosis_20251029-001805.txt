### Final Diagnosis

- **Diabetic autonomic / small‑fiber neuropathy** – Poorly controlled diabetes (HbA1c 8.7 %) with associated autonomic dysfunction can produce tingling, burning, and numbness in the extremities, explaining Kevin’s predominant sensory complaints.  
- **Silent ischemic heart disease/arrhythmias** – The patient’s age, hypertension, smoking history, and uncontrolled diabetes create a high risk for coronary microvascular disease or paroxysmal arrhythmias, which can present as atypical peripheral “burning” pain and may coexist with neuropathic symptoms.  
- **Depression/diabetes‑related distress** – Chronic pain, obesity, smoking, hypertension, and persistent hyperglycemia are strong psychosocial stressors that frequently lead to subclinical depression or health‑related anxiety, which can amplify pain perception and negatively impact self‑management of diabetes and cardiovascular risk.
