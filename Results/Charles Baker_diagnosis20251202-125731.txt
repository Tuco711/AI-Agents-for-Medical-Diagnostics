### Final Diagnosis

[
  {
    "diagnosis": "Uncontrolled Stage 2 Hypertension",
    "confidence_level": "High",
    "synthesis_reasoning": "The Cardiology report explicitly states Mr. Baker's blood pressure is 140/86 mmHg, classifying it as Stage 2 Hypertension per ACC/AHA guidelines, despite being on hydrochlorothiazide. This indicates a clear lack of blood pressure control and is highlighted as a 'Red Flag' requiring urgent re-evaluation and optimization of his antihypertensive regimen. His BMI of 27.9 (overweight) further contributes to this cardiovascular risk."
  },
  {
    "diagnosis": "Suspected Prostatic Pathology (e.g., Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia or Prostate Cancer)",
    "confidence_level": "High",
    "synthesis_reasoning": "While the primary focus was cardiology, the provided data within the 'Cardiology Findings' includes critical urological information. Mr. Baker presents with an elevated PSA (9.5 ng/mL) and a prostate ultrasound showing an enlarged prostate with nodules. These findings are highly suggestive of significant prostatic disease, potentially prostate cancer, and are explicitly listed as 'Red Flags' requiring urgent urological follow-up and likely biopsy. His chief complaint of urinary symptoms (difficulty urinating, weak stream, nocturia) further supports this diagnosis."
  },
  {
    "diagnosis": "High Risk for Hypertensive Heart Disease and Undiagnosed Coronary Artery Disease",
    "confidence_level": "Medium",
    "synthesis_reasoning": "The Cardiology report repeatedly emphasizes Mr. Baker's significant risk for cardiovascular complications due to his age (68), male gender, long-standing uncontrolled hypertension, and overweight status. The absence of comprehensive cardiac diagnostics (ECG, echocardiogram, full electrolyte panel) means that potential asymptomatic end-organ damage (like left ventricular hypertrophy or diastolic dysfunction) or underlying Coronary Artery Disease cannot be ruled out. The report lists 'Uncontrolled Hypertension with Risk of Hypertensive Heart Disease' and 'Undiagnosed Coronary Artery Disease' as suspected etiologies, necessitating a comprehensive cardiovascular workup to assess these risks."
