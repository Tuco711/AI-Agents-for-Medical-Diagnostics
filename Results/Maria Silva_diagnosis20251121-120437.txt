### Final Diagnosis

```python
[
    {
        "diagnosis": "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) with endocrine‑metabolic dysfunction",
        "confidence_level": "High",
        "synthesis_reasoning": "Physicians report irregular menstrual cycles, acne, hirsutism, elevated LH/FSH ratio, and high testosterone – classic biochemical and clinical hallmarks of PCOS. Cardiology and Pulmonology reports (not showing arrhythmias or pulmonary abnormalities) support that the primary pathology is metabolic/endocrine rather than cardiovascular or respiratory."
    },
    {
        "diagnosis": "Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) / Body‑image related adjustment reaction",
        "confidence_level": "Medium",
        "synthesis_reasoning": "The Psychologist’s conceptualization highlights extreme distress about acne, hirsutism, and perceived loss of femininity, along with cognitive distortions, emotional dysregulation, and defense mechanisms (denial, projection) characteristic of BDD. Cardiology and Pulmonology findings are unremarkable, indicating these psychological symptoms are not driven by a physiological cardiac or pulmonary cause."
    },
    {
        "diagnosis": "Adjustment Disorder with anxiety (post‑PCOS diagnosis stress response)",
        "confidence_level": "Low",
        "synthesis_reasoning": "Psychology notes the patient’s acute reaction to the new PCOS diagnosis, marked by shame, rumination, and avoidance behaviors; these align with an adjustment disorder. Lack of objective anxiety or depressive symptoms in the cardiology and pulmonary assessments, and the absence of formal anxiety or depression in the current data, keeps this diagnosis more speculative."
