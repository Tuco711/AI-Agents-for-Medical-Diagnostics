    "Pulmonologist": "**Potential Respiratory Issues:**  \nNone identified – the patient’s history, physical examination, and laboratory findings do not describe any respiratory symptoms, abnormal lung sounds, or other indicators of pulmonary disease.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps:**  \n- No specific pulmonary work‑up is needed at this time.  \n- If any respiratory complaints (cough, wheeze, shortness of breath, chest pain) develop, consider a standard assessment: spirometry, chest X‑ray, or consultation with pulmonology.  \n- Routine health maintenance: reinforce healthy lifestyle (regular exercise, balanced diet) which can also benefit overall respiratory fitness.",
    "Psychologist": "**Possible Mental‑Health Issues**\n\n- Generalized anxiety or health‑related anxiety about PCOS symptoms  \n- Mild to moderate depressive symptoms (low mood, anhedonia)  \n- Body‑image concerns / body dysmorphic disorder‑like preoccupation (acne, hirsutism)  \n- Low self‑esteem or self‑confidence challenges  \n- Risk of disordered eating behaviors (dietary restrictions or compulsive dieting)  \n- Adjustment‑related stress as the condition is chronic  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps**\n\n1. **Screening Assessment**  \n   - Administer PHQ‑9 (depression) and GAD‑7 (anxiety) to gauge severity.  \n   - Evaluate body‑image distress with a brief body‑image scale.  \n\n2. **Referral to Mental‑Health Professional**  \n   - Psychologist or licensed CBT therapist experienced in chronic medical conditions and body‑image issues.  \n\n3. **Integrated Care Coordination**  \n   - Communicate findings to primary care or endocrinology team; consider joint management plan.  \n\n4. **Psychoeducation**  \n   - Provide information about PCOS, its psychological impact, and coping strategies.  \n\n5. **Lifestyle & Supportive Interventions**  \n   - Encourage gradual increase in physical activity as tolerated; physical exercise can reduce anxiety and improve mood.  \n   - Offer referral to a registered dietitian for balanced nutrition; address any disordered eating patterns.  \n   - Suggest stress‑management tools (mindfulness, relaxation techniques, journaling).  \n\n6. **Follow‑Up**  \n   - Re‑assess mood and anxiety in 4–6 weeks; adjust therapeutic approach as needed.  \n\nThese steps aim to identify and treat any underlying psychological distress associated with Maria’s PCOS and its physical manifestations.",
    "Cardiologist": "**Possible Cardiac‑Related Explanations for the Presenting Symptoms**\n\n| Symptom | Cardiac Mechanism | Likelihood in this Patient |\n|---------|-------------------|----------------------------|\n| Irregular menstrual cycles | **Subclinical arrhythmia or autonomic dysfunction** (e.g., premature atrial contractions, atrial fibrillation in early stages) that may alter pituitary‑gonadal axis. | Low – no rhythm disturbances reported yet. |\n| Acne & hirsutism | **Hormonal modulation secondary to cardiac metabolic stress** (e.g., elevated insulin, leptin, or catecholamines). | Low – conventional PCOS is the predominant driver. |\n| Elevated BMI with normal fasting glucose | **Early metabolic syndrome** that can predispose to coronary microvascular dysfunction; may manifest as exercise‑induced fatigue or palpitations. | Moderate – patient at risk; warrants assessment of endothelial function. |\n\n> **Bottom line:** The most plausible explanations for the patient’s reproductive findings remain endocrine (PCOS). Cardiac causes are unlikely but cannot be entirely excluded, especially because subclinical arrhythmias or structural anomalies can be silent until the third to fourth decade of life in women.\n\n---\n\n## Recommended Next Cardiac Assessments\n\n| Test | Why It Is Needed | What to Look For | Frequency / Notes |\n|------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| **Baseline 12‑lead ECG** | Detects conduction defects, early repolarization changes, or silent atrial arrhythmias. | PR prolongation, QRS/QT abnormalities, atrial fibrillation, left/right axis deviation. | One‑time at initial visit. |\n| **Fasting lipid panel & HbA1c** | PCOS patients carry a high cardiovascular risk even with normal glucose. | LDL‑C, HDL‑C, triglycerides, non‑fasting TG >200 mg/dL suggests dyslipidemia. | Repeat annually or sooner if abnormal. |\n| **24‑h Holter or Event Monitor** | Captures intermittent arrhythmias that are not seen on office ECG. | Premature atrial/ventricular beats, supraventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation burdens > 1–2%. | Allocate if patient reports palpitations, syncope, or if baseline ECG abnormal. |\n| **Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE)** | Evaluates ventricular function, valvular integrity, and left atrial size. | Ejection fraction <55%, diastolic dysfunction grade II/III, mitral valve prolapse, structural defects. | One‑time initially; repeat based on findings or symptoms. |\n| **Exercise‑Stress ECG or Cardiac MRI** | Assess for coronary microvascular disease or inducible ischemia in high‑risk PCOS patients. | ST‑segment depression, abnormal heart‑rate response. | Consider if lipids or glucose rise, or if symptoms of exertional chest pain emerge. |\n| **Ambulatory blood‑pressure monitoring** | Detect masked hypertension or nocturnal dipping issues. | BP >140/90 systolic/diastolic 24‑h > 5% of readings. | Repeat annually or when risk factors change. |\n\n---\n\n## Further Management Strategies If Cardiac Findings Emerge\n\n| Potential Cardiac Finding | First‑Line Management | Follow‑Up |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------|-----------|\n| **Atrial fibrillation (paroxysmal or persistent)** | Anticoagulation per CHA₂DS₂‑VASc; rate control (β‑blocker or calcium‑channel blocker); consider rhythm control with antiarrhythmic or catheter ablation. | Clinic review every 6‑month; repeat Holter. |\n| **Diffuse myocardial dysfunction** | Lifestyle optimization (diet, exercise), ACE inhibitor or ARB if LV dysfunction, low‑dose β‑blocker if symptomatic. | Echo at 6‑month intervals. |\n| **Filtration or structural heart disease** | Referral to congenital heart disease specialist; possible surgical evaluation. | Multidisciplinary team follow‑up. |\n| **Abnormal lipid profile** | Statin therapy if LDL‑C > 130 mg/dL or HDL‑C < 50 mg/dL; lifestyle modifications. | Lipid panel every 6‑months. |\n| **Diabetes/Impaired fasting glucose** | Metformin or GLP‑1 agonist; continuous glucose monitoring if needed. | HbA1c every 3‑months until stable. |\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Current evidence points to PCOS** as the primary cause of menstrual irregularities, acne, and hirsutism.\n- **Cardiac causes appear unlikely** at present but cannot be completely ruled out; early screening will mitigate future risk.\n- **Baseline ECG, Holter, lipid panel, and echocardiogram** are the first steps to exclude silent arrhythmias or structural disease.\n- **Identify and manage any metabolic/cardiovascular risk** through medication and lifestyle interventions, especially since PCOS is a pro‑inflammatory state that accelerates ASCVD development.\n\nOnce these tests are completed, revisit the clinical picture to confirm whether the endocrine sequelae remain the sole contributors or if a covert cardiac etiology is uncovered."

  "final_diagnosis": "- **Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)** –  \n  *Why?* The constellation of irregular menstrual cycles, acne, hirsutism, and a normal fasting glucose with an elevated BMI are classic hormonal findings of PCOS. The cardiologist’s evaluation also notes that cardiac mechanisms are unlikely contributors, reinforcing that PCOS is the primary driver of the reproductive symptoms.\n\n- **Early‑stage Metabolic Syndrome / Cardiovascular Risk** –  \n  *Why?* The cardiology report highlights an elevated BMI with a normal  fasting glucose but points out the patient is at moderate risk for coronary micro‑vascular dysfunction and future endothelial injury. A baseline ECG, lipid panel, and echocardiogram are suggested to identify silent cardiac involvement that could emerge as the metabolic profile worsens.\n\n- **Anxiety/Depression & Body‑image Distress (Psychosocial Complications)** –  \n  *Why?* The psychologist identifies generalized anxiety tied to health concerns, mild to moderate depressive symptoms, and significant body‑image preoccupation around acne and hirsutism. These mental‑health challenges can influence adherence to medical therapy, lead to disordered eating, and decrease overall quality of life, warranting routine screening (PHQ‑9, GAD‑7) and integrated behavioral support.",
