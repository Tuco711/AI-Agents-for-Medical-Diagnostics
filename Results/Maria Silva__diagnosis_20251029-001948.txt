### Final Diagnosis

- **Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)** –  
  *Why?* The constellation of irregular menstrual cycles, acne, hirsutism, and a normal fasting glucose with an elevated BMI are classic hormonal findings of PCOS. The cardiologist’s evaluation also notes that cardiac mechanisms are unlikely contributors, reinforcing that PCOS is the primary driver of the reproductive symptoms.

- **Early‑stage Metabolic Syndrome / Cardiovascular Risk** –  
  *Why?* The cardiology report highlights an elevated BMI with a normal  fasting glucose but points out the patient is at moderate risk for coronary micro‑vascular dysfunction and future endothelial injury. A baseline ECG, lipid panel, and echocardiogram are suggested to identify silent cardiac involvement that could emerge as the metabolic profile worsens.

- **Anxiety/Depression & Body‑image Distress (Psychosocial Complications)** –  
  *Why?* The psychologist identifies generalized anxiety tied to health concerns, mild to moderate depressive symptoms, and significant body‑image preoccupation around acne and hirsutism. These mental‑health challenges can influence adherence to medical therapy, lead to disordered eating, and decrease overall quality of life, warranting routine screening (PHQ‑9, GAD‑7) and integrated behavioral support.
