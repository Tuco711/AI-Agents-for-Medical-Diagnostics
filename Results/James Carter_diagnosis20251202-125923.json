    "Senior_Psychologist": "{\n  \"Case Conceptualization\": \"James's presenting complaint of chronic insomnia and fatigue, while seemingly isolated, appears to be a somatic manifestation of deeply ingrained patterns of stress dysregulation and emotional constriction. His \\\"high stress occupation\\\" is not merely an external factor but likely interacts with an internalized drive for achievement or a fear of inadequacy, leading to a persistent state of hyperarousal. The reliance on high caffeine intake is a maladaptive coping mechanism, perpetuating a vicious cycle of fatigue and stimulant dependence, further disrupting his natural sleep-wake rhythm. From a psychodynamic perspective, his inability to \\\"switch off\\\" suggests a difficulty in relinquishing control or allowing for vulnerability and rest, possibly stemming from early relational patterns or an internalized superego that demands constant vigilance and productivity. The family history of maternal depression hints at a potential genetic predisposition to mood dysregulation, which in James may present as chronic anxiety and somatic symptoms rather than overt sadness. His body, through the sleep disturbance, is signaling a profound imbalance and an overwhelmed nervous system that has been operating in a chronic \\\"fight or flight\\\" mode, potentially akin to a complex trauma response to sustained environmental demands.\",\n  \"Differential Diagnosis\": [\n    \"Insomnia Disorder (Primary/Secondary): While the chief complaint, it is likely secondary to underlying anxiety and stress.\",\n    \"Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD): Chronic worry, difficulty controlling worry, and associated physical symptoms (fatigue, sleep disturbance).

The Cardiology report also identifies 'chronic sleep disturbance' and 'daytime fatigue' as central issues, and its 'Anxiety/Stress-Related Sleep Disorder' etiology aligns perfectly with the psychophysiological nature of this diagnosis.
