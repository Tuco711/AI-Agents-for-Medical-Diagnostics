### Final Diagnosis

- **Recurrent Group A streptococcal tonsillitis** –  
  The cardiology report explicitly states the sore throat and tonsillar enlargement are due to repeated GAS infections, and no alternative cardiac or pulmonary etiology was found.  
  • Evidence: ENT findings of exudative tonsils, positive strep test, and persistent symptoms despite normal cardiac and respiratory work‑up.

- **Chronic dysphagia with aspiration risk** –  
  The patient’s persistent difficulty swallowing anechoic with enlarged tonsils predisposes to aspiration, especially if the infection worsens or if the patient coughs/clears the throat forcefully.  
  • Evidence: Pulmonology notes “potential for aspiration‑related lower‑airway infection *if* tonsillitis worsens” and recommends monitoring for cough, wheeze, or dyspnea.

- **Anxiety‑and‑depression related to chronic illness** –  
  The psychologist identified illness‑related anxiety, depressive symptoms, and an adjustment disorder pattern that are common with chronic ENT problems and can exacerbate perception of physical discomfort.  
  • Evidence: Suggested screening with PHQ‑9, GAD‑7, and Illness Anxiety Scale, plus recommendations for CBT and psychoeducation.
