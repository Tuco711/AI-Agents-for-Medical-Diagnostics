    "Pulmonologist": "**Possible Respiratory Issues:**  \n- None identified from the information provided (no history, exam, or lab evidence of asthma, COPD, or lung infection).  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps:**  \n- No pulmonary function testing or imaging is needed at this time.  \n- Focus on sleep‑related interventions: reduce caffeine intake in the afternoon/evening, establish a consistent sleep schedule, and consider stress‑management techniques (e.g., CBT‑for-insomnia or relaxation training).  \n- If sleep disturbances persist or other respiratory symptoms (wheezing, cough, dyspnea) appear, re‑evaluate with a focused respiratory assessment and appropriate testing.",
    "Cardiologist": "**Possible cardiac explanations for the insomnia‑related symptoms**\n\n| Symptom | Potential subtle cardiac cause | Why it could produce the symptom |\n|---------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings | **Nocturnal arrhythmias** (e.g., non‑sustained ventricular tachycardia, premature atrial/ventricular beats, sinus node dysfunction) | Bursts of ectopy or runs of tachycardia can be felt or perceived during the night, triggering arousals or vivid dreams. |\n| Nighttime awakenings → daytime fatigue | **Early diastolic dysfunction / subclinical heart failure** | Small elevations in filling pressures can provoke orthopnea or nocturnal hypoxia without overt apnea, leading to poor sleep quality. |\n| General fatigue | **Subclinical hypertension‑related microvascular disease** | Even well‑controlled BP can produce subtle myocardial strain, leading to subtle changes in myocardial perfusion and sleep regulation. |\n\n*Note:* The sleep study excluded obstructive apnea; thyroid and glucose are normal, so a cardiovascular origin should be ruled out to be thorough.\n\n---\n\n### Recommended next‑step cardiac evaluation\n\n| Test | Rationale | Timing | Expected findings that would alter management |\n|------|-----------|--------|----------------------------------------------|\n| **12‑lead resting ECG** | Detect silent conduction disease, LV hypertrophy, repolarization abnormalities. | Within the next 2 weeks | Any ST‑segment/PR changes would prompt more advanced imaging. |\n| **24‑48 hr Holter** | Capture paroxysmal arrhythmias that are absent in a short‑term monitor; correlate any symptomatic awakenings with rhythm events. | Within 1 month | Identification of non‑sustained VT, frequent PACs/VCBs, or sinus node dysfunction → consider beta‑blocker or eventual pacemaker. |\n| **Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE)** with Doppler and strain imaging | Identify left ventricular systolic/diastolic function, valvular lesions, structural disease (e.g., left atrial enlargement). | Within 1–2 months | Evidence of diastolic dysfunction → titrate ACE‑I/ARB, consider mineralocorticoid antagonist. |\n| **Ambulatory ECG with event trigger (e.g., audio/file‑linked)** | If patient reports nocturnal symptoms, an event recorder can capture rhythm on symptom‑onset. | Parallel to Holter if symptoms high. | Correlation of arousals with specific arrhythmias → targeted therapy. |\n| **Repeat blood pressure monitoring (24‑hr ABPM)** | Verify nocturnal dipping status – non‑dippers are at higher cardiovascular risk and may have night‑time ischemia. | Within 1 month | Non‑dipping → intensify antihypertensive regimen (add bedtime dosing). |\n| **If TTE shows abnormality** | Consider cardiac MRI for detailed tissue characterization or coronary CT angiography if ischemia suspected. | After abnormal echo | Enables detection of myocardial scar, fibrosis, or significant coronary disease. |\n\n---\n\n### Management if a cardiac abnormality is found\n\n| Scenario | First‑line therapy | When to refer to cardiology sub‑specialty |\n|----------|--------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Non‑sustained VT or frequent VCBs** | Beta‑blocker (e.g., metoprolol 25–50 mg BID) or consider nadolol if nocturnal burden. | If symptoms persist after 3 months or VT >5 episodes/24 hr |\n| **Sinus node dysfunction** | Evaluation for pacemaker placement if symptomatic pauses >3 s or symptomatic bradycardia. | Electrophysiology consult |\n| **Early diastolic dysfunction** | Optimize RAAS blockade: increase lisinopril, add low‑dose spironolactone. Consider diuretics if congestion evident. | Cardiac rehab or HF specialist |\n| **Non‑dipper BP pattern** | Add bedtime dosing of antihypertensive. Add a short‑acting agent (e.g., low‑dose nifedipine). | Hypertension specialist |\n\n---\n\n### Non‑cardiac supportive measures while cardiac work‑up is ongoing\n\n* Reduce caffeine intake, especially after noon.\n* Sleep hygiene: fixed bedtime, limited screen time, dark, cool room.\n* Stress‑management techniques (mindfulness, CBT‑I if insomnia persists).\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** The patient’s sleep complaints could be secondary to subtle arrhythmias or early ventricular/diastolic dysfunction that ordinary testing has not yet captured. A 12‑lead ECG followed by Holter monitoring and an echocardiogram are essential first steps. Any abnormal findings would guide tailored pharmacologic or device‑based therapy. If all cardiac tests are normal, a focused sleep medicine referral for further polysomnography (with extended cardiac telemetry) or a neurology assessment may be warranted.",
    "Psychologist": "**Possible Mental Health Issues**\n\n| Issue | Supporting Evidence from Report |\n|-------|---------------------------------|\n| **Insomnia (primary)** | Difficulty initiating sleep, frequent awakenings, daytime fatigue; sleep study shows decreased sleep efficiency, no apnea. |\n| **Anxiety / Hyperarousal** | High‑stress occupation, high caffeine intake; insomnia symptoms often co‑occur with anxiety. |\n| **Depressive Symptoms / Mood Dysfunction** | Family history of depression, persistent fatigue, potential low mood (not explicitly stated but possible given context). |\n| **Chronic Stress / Burnout** | Sustained high workload noted; could contribute to both sleep disturbance and mood/anxiety symptoms. |\n\n---\n\n**Recommended Next Steps**\n\n1. **Cognitive‑Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT‑I)**\n   - Structured program (8–12 weeks) targeting sleep‑related thoughts and behaviors.\n   - Includes sleep restriction, stimulus control, and relaxation training.\n\n2. **Sleep Hygiene Assessment & Education**\n   - Reduce caffeine intake (especially after noon).\n   - Establish a consistent bedtime routine (lights‑down time, screen‑free period, 30‑minute wind‑down).\n   - Optimize bedroom environment (cool, dark, quiet).\n\n3. **Stress‑Management Interventions**\n   - Mindfulness‑based stress reduction or progressive muscle relaxation.\n   - Time‑management coaching or workplace counseling to reduce occupational stress.\n\n4. **Anxiety‑Focused Therapy (CBT‑A)**\n   - If the patient demonstrates significant worry or physiological arousal, add standard CBT techniques for anxiety.\n\n5. **Depression Screening & Monitoring**\n   - Administer a brief mood inventory (e.g., PHQ‑9) at baseline and every 4–6 weeks.\n   - If scores rise above threshold, consider referral to a psychiatrist for pharmacological evaluation.\n\n6. **Multidisciplinary Coordination**\n   - Discuss findings with primary care provider to monitor blood pressure and overall health.\n   - If insomnia persists after behavioral interventions, consider a short‑term trial of a non‑benzodiazepine hypnotic, only under psychiatric guidance.\n\n7. **Lifestyle Modifications**\n   - Encourage regular moderate exercise (e.g., brisk walking) to improve sleep and mood.\n   - Limit evening screen exposure by using blue‑light filters.\n\n**Monitoring Plan**\n- Re‑evaluate sleep quality and mood after 4 weeks of CBT‑I.\n- If improvement is noted, continue to 8–12 weeks; if not, reassess treatment plan.\n- Document any changes in occupational stressors or caffeine consumption.\n\nThese steps emphasize non‑pharmacologic interventions first, with a safety net for monitoring mood and anxiety that may necessitate medication or specialist involvement."

  "final_diagnosis": "- **Nocturnal arrhythmias (e.g., premature atrial/ventricular beats, non‑sustained VT, sinus node dysfunction)**  \n  - *Why*: Bursts of ectopy or brief tachycardic runs can be sensed or felt during the night, triggering arousals, vivid dreams, and fragmented sleep, producing the patient’s difficulty falling asleep and frequent awakenings.\n\n- **Early diastolic dysfunction / subclinical heart failure**  \n  - *Why*: Mild elevations in left‑ventricular filling pressures can lead to nocturnal orthopnea or silent hypoxia without overt obstructive apnea, reducing sleep efficiency and leaving the patient fatigued during the day.\n\n- **Anxiety‑related hyperarousal and mild depressive mood (burnout)**  \n  - *Why*: High‑stress occupation, excess caffeine, and family history of depression create a state of hyperarousal and sleep‑to‑wake cycle instability, accounting for insomnia, daytime fatigue, and the emotional symptoms noted by the psychologist.",
