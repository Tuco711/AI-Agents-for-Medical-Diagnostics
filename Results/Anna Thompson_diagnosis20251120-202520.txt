    {
        "diagnosis": "Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)",
        "confidence_level": "High",
        "synthesis_reasoning": "Cardiology identifies the classic IBS triad of bloating, alternating diarrhea/constipation, and crampy pain with all organic and inflammatory work‑ups negative.  The psychologist corroborates that her symptoms are real and distressing even though no physical disease is found, reinforcing a functional gut disorder.  Pulmonology reports no pulmonary contribution, thereby supporting that the abdominal complaints are not due to lungs or heart.  Together these point squarely to IBS as the primary physiological diagnosis."
    },
    {
        "diagnosis": "Somatic Symptom Disorder / Anxiety‑driven GI dysfunction",
        "confidence_level": "Medium",
        "synthesis_reasoning": "The psychologist outlines catastrophizing, hyper‑vigilance to gut sensations, and a maladaptive belief system that interprets normal gut activity as disease.  Cardiology finds no objective cardiac or inflammatory pathology to explain the symptoms, which aligns with a somatic focus on bodily sensations rather than a pathologic process.  Pulmonology’s absence of pulmonary disease further excludes a somatic source, leaving psychological factors as a plausible driver of symptom amplification."
    },
    {
        "diagnosis": "Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO)",
        "confidence_level": "Low",
        "synthesis_reasoning": "Cardiology lists SIBO as a differential that fits the symptom pattern and recommends breath testing, indicating a potential bacterial basis.  The psychologist notes that rumination and altered gut‑brain signaling could exacerbate SIBO symptoms, while Pulmonology’s normal lung function suggests the digestive symptoms are not secondary to respiratory compromise.  Although no test has confirmed SIBO yet, its inclusion in the cardio differential and its compatibility with the psychologic stress‑gut link justify a low‑confidence hypothesis."
