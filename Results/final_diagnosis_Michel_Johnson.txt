### Final Diagnosis:

**Possible health issues**

- **Paroxysmal cardiac arrhythmia (e.g., SVT/VT, CPVT, or a brief ventricular/supraventricular tachycardia)**
  - Episodes are 10–20 min long, with palpitations, dizziness, diaphoresis, and a feeling of impending doom—all classic ACS‑like signatures of a brief, sometimes silent tachyarrhythmia that a 24‑h Holter can miss. The Holter only shows occasional PVCs, so an intermittent, low‑frequency arrhythmia is still plausible.

- **Panic disorder / anxiety‑driven hyperventilation syndrome**
  - The patient reports recurrent, unexpected chest pain, SOB, sweating, dizziness, and doom‑spells that are perfectly aligned with panic attack criteria. Psychological work‑up lists panic disorder, health‑related anxiety, and GAD, and the cardiopulmonary evaluations are unremarkable—typical of neuro‑cardiogenic or hyperventilation‑induced episodes.

- **GERD or esophageal spasm mimicking cardiac pain**
  - A burning/chest‑tightness often associated with reflux can produce pain that feels cardiac. GERD can escalate anxiety, creating a feedback loop of chest discomfort and panic. The reports note GERD as a potential culprit, and the lack of objective cardiac or pulmonary pathology keeps reflux as a likely contributor.
