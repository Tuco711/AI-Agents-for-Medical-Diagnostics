    "Pulmonologist": "**Potential Respiratory Issues:**  \nNone identified in the current report. The examination, vital signs, and laboratory data show no evidence of asthma, COPD, or lung infection.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps:**  \n- No specific pulmonary testing or imaging is warranted at this time.  \n- If the patient develops new respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, wheeze, shortness of breath) or if the abdominal complaints resolve and other symptoms arise, consider a basic spirometry evaluation and chest imaging as appropriate.  \n- Continue routine health maintenance and monitor for any change in respiratory status.",
    "Cardiologist": "**Possible cardiac contributors to the abdominal symptoms**  \nNone of the available clinical data (normal CBC, normal CRP, unremarkable physical exam, normal blood pressure/heart rate) indicate a cardiac process that could manifest as bloating, altered bowel habits, or cramping pain. No symptoms of palpitations, syncope, or exertional chest discomfort that would prompt a targeted cardiac work‑up were reported.\n\n**Recommended next steps**\n\n1. **Baseline 12‑lead ECG** – A quick, non‑invasive screening to ensure there is no underlying arrhythmia (e.g., PACs, PAC‑related atrial tachycardia) or conduction abnormality that could have been missed.  \n2. **If ECG is abnormal or if the patient reports syncopal episodes, palpitations, or unexplained tachycardia in the future** –  \n   • Arrange a **24‑48‑hour Holter monitor** to capture intermittent arrhythmias.  \n   • Consider a **transthoracic echocardiogram** to evaluate ventricular function and structural heart disease if Holter findings are suggestive of atrial fibrillation or supraventricular tachycardia that may cause hemodynamic compromise affecting gut motility.  \n3. **Parallel GI work‑up** – Since the abdominal picture remains unexplained by the current cardiac assessment, proceed with targeted gastrointestinal investigations (e.g., stool osmotic gap, hydrogen breath test, small‑bowel imaging, functional bowel studies) as the next clinical priority.\n\n**Summary**  \n- No evidence of a hidden cardiac issue explaining the GI symptoms.  \n- A routine ECG is prudent as a baseline; further cardiac monitoring reserved for new or worsening cardio‑symptoms.  \n- Continue exhaustive GI evaluation per the normal findings already obtained.",
    "Psychologist": "**Possible Mental‑Health Concerns**\n\n| Symptom from Report | Potential Issue | Why It Fits |\n|----------------------|-----------------|-------------|\n| Chronic abdominal bloating & pain with no organic cause | **Somatic Symptom Disorder / Illness Anxiety Disorder** | Persistent physical symptoms that are not explained biologically can drive anxiety about health. |\n| Stress‑related trigger (e.g., diet changes, work pressure) | **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)** | “Bloating” and pain often worsening in stressful moments suggest anxiety‑related GI sensitivity. |\n| Limited mention of mood or sleep changes | **Subclinical Depression** | Chronic pain may affect sleep and motivation; even mild depression can present with GI complaints. |\n| No overt positive coping strategies indicated | **Health‑Related Stress/PTSD‑like** | The gut‑brain axis is highly sensitive; ongoing discomfort can lead to hypervigilance and avoidance of activities. |\n\n**Recommended Next Steps**\n\n1. **Screening & Baseline Measures**\n   - Administer **GAD‑7** and **PHQ‑9** to quantify anxiety and depressive symptomatology.\n   - Use a **Somatic Symptom Scale** (e.g., PHQ‑15) to assess functional impact.\n\n2. **Integrated GI‑Psychological Assessment**\n   - Refer to a **psychologist/psychiatrist** experienced in **GI psychosomatic disorders** (e.g., IBD or IBS).\n   - Consider a joint **GI‑psychiatry clinic visit** for coordinated care.\n\n3. **Evidence‑Based Interventions**\n   - **Cognitive‑Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** focused on body‑image, catastrophic thoughts, and coping with pain.  \n   - **Mindfulness‑Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)** to modulate gut motility and reduce visceral anxiety.  \n   - **Diet‑based CBT** (“IBS‑CBT”) to link dietary triggers and anxiety patterns.\n\n4. **Pharmacologic Options (if indicated)**\n   - Low‑dose **SSRIs or SNRIs** for mild‑to‑moderate anxiety or depression that accompany functional GI symptoms.\n   - Short‑term anxiolytics (e.g., low‑dose propranolol or clonazepam) only if CBT/behavioral strategies are not immediately available.\n\n5. **Lifestyle & Self‑Management**\n   - **Regular physical activity** (moderate aerobic exercise 30 min/day) to reduce visceral hypersensitivity.  \n   - **Sleep hygiene**: 7–9 hrs/night, consistent bedtime routine, avoid screens 1 h pre‑sleep.  \n   - **Stress‑reduction techniques**: diaphragmatic breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, journaling.  \n   - **Support group**: Join a local or online IBS/functional GI condition support group for normalized experiences and coping skills.\n\n6. **Follow‑Up Plan**\n   - Re‑assess anxiety, depression, and somatic symptom scores at 4–6 weeks to gauge response.  \n   - Adjust therapy intensity or medication dose as needed.  \n   - Re‑consult the GI specialist if new structural symptoms arise or pain intensifies.\n\n**Bottom Line:**  \nAnna’s persistent abdominal symptoms, with no organic finding, strongly point toward a functional GI disorder that is commonly amplified by anxiety or somatic worry. A coordinated, biopsychosocial approach—screening, CBT/MBSR, possible low‑dose SSRIs, and lifestyle tweaks—offers the most promising path to relief and improved overall well‑being."

  "final_diagnosis": "- **Functional gastrointestinal disorder (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome)** – The patient’s persistent bloating, altered bowel habits, and cramping pain have no organic explanation after cardiac, pulmonary, and basic laboratory work‑ups; GI‑specific testing is now recommended, fitting the classic presentation of IBS or functional gut syndromes.  \n\n- **Anxiety‑related somatic‑symptom/illness‑anxiety disorder** – The psychologist identified stress‑triggered gastrointestinal sensitivity, chronic worry about health, and a pattern of somatic complaints that heighten in stressful moments; these findings point to a psychogenic component that can amplify GI symptoms.\n\n- **Potential intermittent cardiac arrhythmia (e.g., premature atrial contractions or supraventricular tachycardia)** – Though currently absent on routine examination, the cardiologist’s plan for a baseline ECG and future Holter monitoring reflects a concern that subclinical arrhythmia could transiently alter gut perfusion or motility, producing the abdominal symptoms observed.",
