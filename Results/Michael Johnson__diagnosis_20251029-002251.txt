### Final Diagnosis

**Three most likely health issues – and why they fit Michael’s picture**

- **Transient supraventricular tachycardia (SVT, AVNRT/AVRT or non‑sustained ventricular tachycardia)**  
  *Why it fits:*  
  • The cardiology report warns that a 24‑hour Holter can “miss abrupt, brief runs” of arrhythmia, yet the patient reports 10‑20 min episodes of palpitations, chest pain and sweating.  
  • PVCs are present but “do not prove a clinically significant arrhythmia.”  
  • An extended Holter (≥ 7 days) or event recorder is recommended precisely because such episodes are intermittent and often terminate before being recorded.

- **Panic disorder with health‑/somatic–anxiety**  
  *Why it fits:*  
  • The psychologist report shows classic panic‑attack features: sudden chest pain, SOB, dizziness, sweating, and a sense of impending doom that lasts 10‑20 min.  
  • Episodes occur 1–2 × week, recur without a clear physiological trigger, and are accompanied by catastrophic thoughts (“dying, heart attack”).  
  • Normal cardiac work‑up has not allayed the fear, a hallmark of health anxiety.

- **Hyperventilation syndrome / occult (exercise‑induced) asthma**  
  *Why it fits:*  
  • Pulmonology notes “hyperventilation / anxiety‑related respiratory dysfunction” as a likely culprit for the SOB, chest tightness, dizziness, and sweating when physical exam is otherwise unremarkable.  
  • No wheeze is observed, yet 29‑year‑old adults can have poorly‑tolerated, exercise‑induced asthma that remains silent on routine exam.  
  • The patient’s symptoms can be triggered by caffeine/alcohol or emotional stress—substances that both provoke hyperventilation and pulmonary irritation (GERD).

These three possibilities encompass the cardiac, psychiatric, and respiratory dimensions highlighted in the multidisciplinary reports and should be prioritized in the next‑step work‑up.
